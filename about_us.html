                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p style="display: block;">In the spirit of ideas worth spreading ,TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring
                    people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event,TED Talks video and live speakers
                    combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded
                    TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for
                    the TEDx program,but individual TEDx events are self-organized.(Subject to certain rules and
                    regulations.) TEDxYouth@DPSMIS is the longest running youth event in Doha, Qatar. It is organized by
                    DPS Modern Indian School with an aim to provide a platform where ideas exchange and conversations
                    ignite. This year’s theme, “The Art of Flaws” is a philosophical perspective that encourages
                    individuals to perceive imperfections as intrinsic elements of human experience rather than
                    deficiencies. It encompasses the acknowledgment and acceptance of one's own vulnerabilities,
                    idiosyncrasies, and imperfections as essential components that contribute to the uniqueness and
                    richness of life.</p>
